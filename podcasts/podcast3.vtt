This podcast is supported by the Icahn School

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.440
of Medicine at Mount Sinai, one of America's

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.320
leading research medical schools.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.460
Icahn Mount Sinai is the academic arm of

5
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.840
the eight-hospital Mount Sinai Health System in

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.340
New York City.

7
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.860
It's consistently among the top recipients of NIH

8
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.320
funding.

9
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.820
Researchers at Icahn Mount Sinai have made breakthrough

10
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.620
discoveries in many fields vital to advancing the

11
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.460
health of patients, including cancer, COVID and long

12
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.619
COVID, cardiology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

13
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.540
The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,

14
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.760
we find a way.

15
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.970
This is a science podcast for November 17th,

16
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.770
2023.

17
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.170
I'm Sarah Crespi.

18
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.650
First up this week, have you been talking

19
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.310
to Alexa about the weather lately?

20
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590
Staff writer, Paul Vucin, joins us to discuss

21
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.630
how artificial intelligence is suddenly and shockingly good

22
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.250
at forecasting the weather, using way fewer resources

23
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.730
than other modeling systems.

24
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.770
Next, we're focusing on municipal solid waste, things

25
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.150
like landfills, composting centers, garbage dumps, and how

26
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.870
these sites may offer a more straightforward path

27
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.390
to lower carbon emissions.

28
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.150
Researcher Zengxuan Hui discusses his science paper on

29
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.130
this overlooked source of methane and some plausible

30
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.470
solutions for reducing these emissions.

31
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.040
I used to live in a large metropolitan

32
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.220
area and one of the big city perks

33
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.160
that I enjoyed the most was that there

34
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.300
was a daily weather blog run by experts,

35
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.280
including meteorologists, just talking about the weather for

36
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.420
the day, giving in-depth explanations of what

37
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.180
I was seeing out my window or what

38
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.160
happened last night.

39
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.160
And I learned a lot, and I learned

40
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.260
a lot about some weather phenomena on the

41
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.560
podcast.

42
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.120
I do know we have about a 10

43
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.800
-day forecast range with some certainty, and we're

44
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.260
pretty darn good at six days of forecasting,

45
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.800
six days out, and that there are competing

46
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.320
models used to make these type of predictions.

47
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.180
But now there's a new modeler in town.

48
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.160
This week, staff writer Paul Vucin wrote about

49
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.980
AI's contribution to weather forecasting and the surprising

50
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.820
leaps these systems are making in predictive power.

51
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.820
Hi, Paul.

52
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.220
Welcome back to the Science Podcast.

53
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
Hi, good to be here.

54
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.540
I know all of us have been taken

55
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.340
off guard at some point by improvements in

56
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.180
AI, you know, whether it's writing an email

57
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.020
or predicting protein structures, but I hate to

58
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.380
say it, weather was not on my radar.

59
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.420
Did you see this coming, Paul, this leap

60
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.700
in forecasting by AI?

61
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.540
You know, I don't think a lot of

62
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.060
people saw it coming if you go back

63
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.620
even two, two and a half years ago.

64
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.000
People had been trying this five years ago,

65
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.880
and it just didn't seem like it worked

66
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.420
that well.

67
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.020
And then all of a sudden, it did

68
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.360
work.

69
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.220
There are modelers out there using supercomputers, basically,

70
00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.300
to put out forecasts.

71
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.720
They're using math and measurements and physics.

72
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.960
And this has improved over the years, kind

73
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.600
of at a large cost, like in terms

74
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.560
of computing power.

75
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.760
And now these AI models are turning out

76
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.280
pretty competitive results.

77
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.420
You know, how do they stack up?

78
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.240
How do the European model and the AI

79
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.820
modelers, how do they compare?

80
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.360
Yeah, so the European Weather Forecasting Agency is

81
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.080
the top performer in the world.

82
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.140
And they use these very physically based models

83
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.880
that ingest all the observations from satellites and

84
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.860
everything, and then solve all the equations of

85
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.140
fluid motion on a little grid that stimulates

86
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.220
the entire atmosphere.

87
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.940
So that's the top in class.

88
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.320
Now, these kind of AI models are matching

89
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.600
the top weather forecasting model or exceeding it.

90
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.620
In some cases, 90% of the different

91
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.140
metrics looked at over a 10-day forecast.

92
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.680
Right.

93
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.520
And what are they doing differently?

94
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.240
Well, so fundamentally, these have been trained by

95
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.940
the weather models.

96
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.480
They take the data, the weather data that

97
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.180
has been run through these models.

98
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.240
And they've been doing this now for 40

99
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.520
years.

100
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.640
So they take this gigantic data set, they

101
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.620
ingest it.

102
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.760
And I mean, this is classic deep learning,

103
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.640
but on a very kind of large scale

104
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.760
over a graph versus, you know, like an

105
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.880
image type processing.

106
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.459
They're not solving equations.

107
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.899
They're just learning patterns really over a very

108
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.300
complex incomprehensible scale to us in this black

109
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.680
box.

110
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.720
And it's spitting out what should come next.

111
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.020
This is what we see with the ones

112
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.320
that write emails for us.

113
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.220
They have this huge corpus that they've studied.

114
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.400
It has a really good model for saying,

115
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.400
that's the word that comes next in an

116
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.600
email.

117
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.680
That's the most likely next word and doing

118
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.900
that at the paragraph scale or doing it

119
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.500
at the global scale for weather.

120
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.280
Are all the models that are out there,

121
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.860
all the different AIs because there's not just

122
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.620
one company or one academic institution working on

123
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.760
this.

124
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.420
Are they all doing the same thing or

125
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.740
are there, should we lump them all together

126
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.320
or are some of them different than others?

127
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.340
You know, I would lump them.

128
00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.820
Okay.

129
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.340
There are differences in architecture, but as these

130
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.040
have gotten big enough and as long as

131
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.880
you have enough computing power to throw at

132
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.760
the start, enough data, it doesn't seem to

133
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.060
matter that much.

134
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.920
You know, it's kind of 1%, 2%

135
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.440
differences.

136
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.060
You can have different approaches, but really in

137
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.460
the end you're getting to about the same

138
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.840
place.

139
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.420
Right.

140
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.560
We should talk about computing power here.

141
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.320
I mentioned supercomputers being involved in the forecasting

142
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.380
that's been done for the past 40 years.

143
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.120
That's not what happens when you've already trained

144
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.940
your model and now you want to, you

145
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.440
know, have an AI in your newsroom.

146
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.800
It doesn't need multiple banks of servers and

147
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.460
processors.

148
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.340
Nope.

149
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.020
It just needs one fancy desktop computer that's

150
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.480
designed for running these type of models and

151
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.060
it can run it in one minute versus

152
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.580
say two hours for a gigantic supercomputer.

153
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.240
What does that mean?

154
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.340
Like how does that change the world?

155
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.560
I feel like it should, but maybe I

156
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.160
don't need to model weather in my house.

157
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.960
You don't need to model weather in your

158
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.240
house.

159
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.300
What is the impact here?

160
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.920
I mean, the impact is going to be

161
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.820
more for these weather agencies, you know, who

162
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.720
are really starting to look at this closely.

163
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.940
Right now they run these models a lot

164
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.720
of times over, 50 times the European model

165
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.960
is run as slightly a higher or lower

166
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.520
resolution.

167
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.780
Every six hours, they kind of do this

168
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.080
over and over four times a day.

169
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.320
And that kind of running it over and

170
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.080
over gives you some more sense of the

171
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.760
possibility in the future because, you know, butterfly

172
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.460
effect and chaos in the atmosphere, that's all

173
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.240
super expensive.

174
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.960
If they're able to figure out how to

175
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.200
make these AI models first able to continue

176
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.620
to verify that they are fit for purpose

177
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.740
and all the different ways that are needed

178
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.720
and establish some trust in them, you can

179
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.040
maybe start kind of doing this a lot

180
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.660
more cheaply.

181
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.440
Maybe that's just less CO2 emissions from what

182
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.560
you're running, or you can kind of devote

183
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.060
that computing power to solving other problems like

184
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.500
how to better ingest all this weather data

185
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.780
or things like that.

186
00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.280
Yeah.

187
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.720
Speaking of ingesting, do we need to training

188
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.560
these AI models?

189
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.900
Do they need to keep refining their predictions?

190
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.980
Yeah, they would certainly have to periodically update

191
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.360
these.

192
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.280
This Google DeepMind model that is in science

193
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.080
this week, they ran, it took like four

194
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.780
weeks on their dedicated machines to train it.

195
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.660
So, you know, it's something you can see

196
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.520
it theoretically doing every year without being a

197
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.100
huge issue.

198
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.500
We're talking about weather here, you know, what

199
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.840
happens day to day, but could an AI

200
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.200
like this model climate change, make predictions about

201
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.900
climate change?

202
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.520
Yeah.

203
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.140
So climate is a totally different issue in

204
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.720
many ways because the past, this data we

205
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.200
have, is not necessarily predictive of the future

206
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.840
of the climate.

207
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.200
You know, we're changing things a lot.

208
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.440
There are things in the future, ice sheets

209
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.700
melting, things collapsing that just wouldn't be in

210
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.460
the training data.

211
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.640
So it would be very difficult to trust

212
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.340
these projections going forward.

213
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.580
But there are ways that it could be

214
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.100
very helpful where you can take these climate

215
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.440
models.

216
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.040
There's this new class of climate model that

217
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.800
runs in super high resolutions, directly recreating lots

218
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.760
of stuff in the atmosphere.

219
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.200
And we can only afford to run this

220
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.960
on supercomputers for a few years at a

221
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.320
time.

222
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.700
It's kind of slowly pushing out.

223
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.060
So you get that running long enough, and

224
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.380
then you can train the AI on that

225
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.340
and run it a bunch of times.

226
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.400
And then you really start to get a

227
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.160
lot more value from all that computing power

228
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.120
that you've poured into it.

229
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.540
So there's a lot of promise there.

230
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.460
Are we going to stop doing the numerical

231
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.799
modeling, you know, using physics, using measurement to

232
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.860
make forecasts?

233
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.980
Not anytime in the near future.

234
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.700
We have a lot of trust in this

235
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.100
numerical weather modeling.

236
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.880
And you know, if the AI is a

237
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.360
black box, there's that question of how far

238
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.020
do you trust it?

239
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.840
Also, these numerical weather models are producing the

240
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.300
data sets that the AI is being trained

241
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.520
on.

242
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.300
There's kind of, you can't get there without

243
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.580
that.

244
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.180
There's some theoretical future where perhaps the AI

245
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.580
can start ingesting the satellite data directly, or

246
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.640
all the sensor data directly, and take it

247
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.160
end to end.

248
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.340
But we are very far away from that,

249
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:06.960
I believe.

250
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.680
Or maybe we're just two years away.

251
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.080
Who knows?

252
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:10.760
Okay.

253
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.480
What will AI do next?

254
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.720
How is it going to affect your beat

255
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.620
next, Paul?

256
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.660
What area is it going to affect?

257
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.980
It's filtering in lots of ways.

258
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.960
I mean, the image recognition parts of it

259
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.080
are just almost unremarkable at this point, where

260
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.600
like, oh, this can spot icebergs better.

261
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.160
It's like, yeah, you know, of course, again,

262
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.320
anything that's a visual learning type of thing.

263
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.920
I'll have another story in a few weeks

264
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.300
that will also be about AI and satellites,

265
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.580
and look out for that.

266
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.580
That's great.

267
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:42.940
Okay.

268
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.920
Well, thank you so much for coming on

269
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.400
the show, Paul.

270
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:45.960
I appreciate it.

271
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.820
Yeah, thank you.

272
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.260

science.

Researchers Zengxuan Hui talks about modeling landfill emissions

279
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.080
on a global scale.

280
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.340
We don't think about garbage enough.

281
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.240
According to a paper this week in Science,

282
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.980
global municipal waste is a missed opportunity for

283
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.740
reducing emissions and meeting climate goals.

284
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.800
Zengxuan Hui is an author on the article,

285
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.580
and he's here to talk about it.

286
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.260
Hi, Hui.

287
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.420
Welcome to the Science Podcast.

288
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.040
Hi, thanks for having me.

289
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:33.760
Oh, sure.

290
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.780
So how is the landfill in my town

291
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.300
or in your town related to climate change

292
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:40.900
and emissions?

293
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.420
Why is it a carbon source?

294
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.900
Solid waste are actually made up of a

295
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.840
large variety of compositions.

296
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.980
It is made up of, for example, food

297
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.800
waste, paper waste, plastic waste, and so on.

298
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.980
So the organic content in waste decomposes and

299
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.760
predominantly generates methane gas, making solid waste one

300
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.360
of the top methane and methane sectors in

301
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.680
the world.

302
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.240
And methane is an even stronger greenhouse gas

303
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.200
than carbon dioxide.

304
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:08.900
Yeah.

305
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.860
So methane is a potent greenhouse gas that

306
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.420
traps significantly higher amounts of heat than that

307
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.260
of carbon dioxide.

308
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.740
So for example, let's consider a scenario where

309
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.080
we have two different sources of emissions, one

310
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.520
releasing methane and the other releasing carbon dioxide

311
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.380
in the same quantities over 20 years.

312
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.480
The methane emission will trap 80 times more

313
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.500
heat than the carbon dioxide emissions over those

314
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.060
20 years.

315
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.340
And this emphasizes the urgency of addressing methane

316
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.780
emission to effectively mitigate short-term climate change.

317
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.500
Yeah.

318
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.280
So we do hear a lot about reducing

319
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.860
emissions from things like energy sources, like going

320
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.480
solar, or reducing emissions from cars by switching

321
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.820
to electrical vehicles.

322
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.100
There are a lot of sources of carbon

323
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.460
out there.

324
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.540
Why is it important to focus on municipal

325
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.040
waste, garbage, landfills, that kinds of thing?

326
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.720
I think solid waste management is a powerful

327
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.600
but overlooked climate solution.

328
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.180
Some may perceive waste management as a relatively

329
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.200
minor contributor to overall greenhouse gas emissions, like

330
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.180
compared to the big boys such as energy

331
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.420
and transportation.

332
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.000
But we may be undermining its climate impact

333
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.400
because the major greenhouse gas emissions from solid

334
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.760
waste is methane.

335
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.140
And methane actually traps significantly higher amounts of

336
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.740
heat than carbon dioxide.

337
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.440
So in your paper, you attempted to quantify

338
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.980
this, to count up to some extent how

339
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.880
much is coming off of these sources for

340
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.660
carbon emissions.

341
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.680
Can you talk a little bit about what

342
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.800
timescale you looked at and how you counted

343
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.500
this up?

344
00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.580
We forecasted the business as usual greenhouse gas

345
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.740
emissions that would be emitted from the solid

346
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.960
waste sector from 2021 until 2050.

347
00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.820
After we did this forecast, we actually tried

348
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.400
to explore whether there are any technical and

349
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.280
financially plausible mitigation strategies within the solid waste

350
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.500
management, and we visualized them into future emissions

351
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.380
pathway as well.

352
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.220
So what are some of the ways that

353
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.180
we could cut back on emissions from landfills,

354
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.620
from solid waste?

355
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.700
Yeah, so we understand that every country faces

356
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.900
a unique and exclusive version of this challenge

357
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.200
to improve their solid waste management.

358
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.620
And it is important to propose mitigation strategies

359
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.880
based on their diverse situation regarding its required

360
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.160
costs, technology readiness, skilled worker requirements, and their

361
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.700
standing in the waste management hierarchy.

362
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.400
So considering these requirements, we explored four individual

363
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.040
mitigation strategies for reducing emissions from the solid

364
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.560
waste sector.

365
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.920
So firstly, it is retrofitting landfills with biogas

366
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.300
capture.

367
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.940
Secondly, diverting organic waste for composting.

368
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.180
Thirdly, diverting organic waste for anaerobic digestion.

369
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.600
And lastly, reducing waste generation by 50%

370
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.140
relative to 2020 levels.

371
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.480
Okay, so looking across these four different scenarios,

372
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.060
some of these are more social or behavioral

373
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.620
interventions.

374
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.000
I'm thinking, you know, reducing how much waste

375
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
we create in the first place or sorting

376
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.320
out trash from compost.

377
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.120
Others are more technological.

378
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.900
And these are things that you're talking about,

379
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.220
like retrofitting landfills to capture methane.

380
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.520
Or another kind of technical intervention is these

381
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.620
biogas digesters.

382
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.420
So you basically digest compost with microbes and

383
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.140
then you get that methane.

384
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.240
And either the retrofitted landfill methane or the

385
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.820
digest methane, that can be burned as fuel,

386
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.500
which is, you know, a less carbon-intense

387
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.000
approach than just releasing the atmosphere.

388
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.360
You know, when you calculate across all these

389
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.820
different waste situations that countries have, who fits

390
00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.960
best with what?

391
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.100
Like, who should be doing which of these

392
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.500
things to get the most benefit from these

393
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:57.960
strategies?

394
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.260
Our findings found that high-income countries should

395
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.580
prioritize reducing their waste volume and lower-income

396
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.620
countries should prioritize managing their organic waste more

397
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.100
sustainably.

398
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.820
This is because lower-income countries generally tend

399
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.600
to generate waste compositions with a higher organic

400
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.400
content, as opposed to high-income countries.

401
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.600
But generally speaking, the two levers that we

402
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.860
identified for minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from global

403
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.660
solid waste system is firstly, to reduce the

404
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.880
waste volume being generated.

405
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.220
And secondly, managing organic waste more sustainably.

406
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.040
And if these were maximized, if this was

407
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.200
something that people did and took on, how

408
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.980
much reduction could we potentially see in emissions

409
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.620
from solid waste?

410
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.820
These proposed mitigation strategies by themselves would be

411
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.600
able to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that

412
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.940
would be emitted and cumulated in the atmosphere

413
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.640
in the next 30 years by 27 to

414
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.060
70 percent relative to business as usual.

415
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.480
Okay, so how does that translate into the

416
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.300
1.5 degree limit that we're trying to

417
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:03.760
stay under?

418
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.720
Staying within the 1.5 degree Celsius limit

419
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.100
requires adopting more than one strategy.

420
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.800
But we find that if we adopt multiple

421
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.380
strategies, including retrofitting landfills, composting our organic waste

422
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.660
and halving our waste generation, could actually prevent

423
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.600
overshooting the Paris Agreement temperature limits.

424
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.620
What's more interesting is this will also result

425
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.440
in a global solid waste system with net

426
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.040
zero warming relative to 2020 levels.

427
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.800
In other words, no further warming is induced

428
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.320
compared to 2020 levels.

429
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.960
Let's talk about the Global Methane Pledge.

430
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.320
I think most people are familiar with climate

431
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.380
agreements, but maybe they haven't heard about this

432
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.640
other one about methane.

433
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.920
Methane was determined to be of particular importance

434
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.000
at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference

435
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.360
of the Parties because it has a short

436
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.340
lifetime of approximately one decade, so cutting its

437
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.300
emission can rapidly decelerate near-term global warming.

438
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.720
So more than 100 countries come together to

439
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.339
sign the Global Methane Pledge, aiming to curb

440
00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.579
30% of global methane emission by 2030

441
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.960
using a 2020 level baseline.

442
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.400
How does this help with that?

443
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.480
We actually look into whether the mitigation strategies

444
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.520
that we propose can actually help us to

445
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.220
achieve the Global Methane Pledge.

446
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.200
Well, it's actually achievable, but there's a catch.

447
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.940
Because we designed these mitigation strategies only to

448
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.160
be fully adopted by 2050, so it cannot

449
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.060
actually reduce 30% of methane emission from

450
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.000
the solid waste sector in a timely manner.

451
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.860
We will actually need to accelerate the complete

452
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.880
adoption of mitigation strategies by at least 9

453
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.980
to 17 years, which is to completely adopt

454
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.160
all these strategies by 2033 to 2044, depending

455
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.200
on the mitigation strategies, in order for us

456
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.340
to be on track with the progress to

457
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.800
achieve the Global Methane Pledge.

458
00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.520
Kind of the surprise here, I think, besides

459
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.400
the fact that this is such an impactful

460
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.980
intervention, is that all the technologies that you're

461
00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.720
talking about are already in existence, so they

462
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.200
don't rely on a bunch of innovations to,

463
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.580
you know, say, take carbon out of the

464
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.320
air or invent a new kind of battery.

465
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.980
It's just, do these things we already know

466
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.740
how to do?

467
00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.440
What do you see as the hurdles to

468
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.500
getting this to happen?

469
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.000
So the good thing is these technologies are

470
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.720
actually readily available technologies, but to realize an

471
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.900
efficient waste management system, policymakers need to utilize

472
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.660
three types of policy tools to also promote

473
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.020
people to actually do these kinds of things.

474
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.320
I want to highlight that the first one

475
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.880
is direct regulation, which is encompassing laws to

476
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.100
be enforced rigorously, such as mandating waste segregation

477
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.060
in each household.

478
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.180
Secondly, economic incentive and disincentive to encourage reduction

479
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.960
in waste generation and increase recycling efforts.

480
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.020
And thirdly, social tools, such as the promotion

481
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.040
of education campaigns to inculcate environmental values in

482
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.800
communities to generate less waste.

483
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.100
Thank you so much, Hoi.

484
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:06.880
Thank you.
