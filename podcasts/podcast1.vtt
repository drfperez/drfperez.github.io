00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.100
This is a science podcast for June 21st,

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.720
2024.

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm Megan Cantwell, filling in for Sarah Crespi.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.160
First up this week, staff writer Dan Cleary

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.800
joins me to talk about the hunt for

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.200
habitable exoplanets.

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.740
What started as a search focused on Earth

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.480
-like rocky planets is expanding to planets with

9
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.200
thicker atmospheres, or even planets wrapped entirely in

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.540
water.

11
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.020
Next, producer Arianna Remmel talks to researcher Ava

12
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.020
Fannershtil about an unexpected source of volatile organic

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.000
compounds causing air quality to worsen on hot

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.180
days in Los Angeles.

15
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200
If you were to be on one of

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.700
the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, what

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.520
would that be like?

18
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
What would that feel like?

19
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.600
Living on one of these planets around TRAPPIST

20
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.240
-1 would be very bizarre to us.

21
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.680
You'd be living in this sort of strip

22
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.520
around the order of nighttime and daytime in

23
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.440
perpetual sunset.

24
00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.080
The other thing that would be very peculiar

25
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.340
would be the other planets because they're all

26
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.720
very bunched close together.

27
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.640
When one came close, it would be larger

28
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.360
than the moon.

29
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.920
If more than one of those planets were

30
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.480
inhabited, you would be able to see the

31
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.060
lights of towns and buildings and so on

32
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.260
on a neighboring planet as it drifted by.

33
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.860
It would be a strange, very science fiction

34
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.960
-like existence living on one of these planets.

35
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140
There's no doubt that living on a planet

36
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.720
in the TRAPPIST-1 system 41 light-years

37
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.880
away from Earth would be nothing like existence

38
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.760
as we know it.

39
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.180
But that doesn't rule out the possibility that

40
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.000
there could be some sort of life present.

41
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.640
This Week in Science staff reporter Dan Cleary

42
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.760
wrote about the hunt for other Earth-like

43
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.480
planets and the hurdles that researchers have faced

44
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.060
so far in this pursuit.

45
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.860
Thank you so much for joining me on

46
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.580
the podcast, Dan.

47
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.540
My pleasure.

48
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.400
This is definitely not the first sort of

49
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.520
story where you've covered potentially life on other

50
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.400
planets, whether other planets are habitable.

51
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.500
But now, within the past few years, JWST

52
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.580
finally launched, giving us new insight into these

53
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.860
planets.

54
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.700
What can we probe into these planets that

55
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.440
we couldn't before?

56
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.000
What JWST gives them, first of all, is

57
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.340
it's a space telescope.

58
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.860
So it's looking at objects a long way

59
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.760
away, but without the interference from the atmosphere

60
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.480
in between.

61
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.560
JWST is not only a lot bigger than

62
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.940
Hubble, but it covers a very different wavelength

63
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.580
range.

64
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.940
So it's mostly in the infrared.

65
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.000
It can look at cooler objects.

66
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.560
It can hopefully detect molecules that are useful

67
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.960
to life in the atmospheres of these sort

68
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.620
of planets that we've been talking about.

69
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.560
They already are discovering amazing things, but mostly,

70
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.000
thus far, about much bigger and hotter planets.

71
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.520
To look at the smaller, cooler ones that

72
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.180
could possibly host life, it takes more time.

73
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.840
Researchers have had such a long time to

74
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.860
dream up their kind of ideal list of

75
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.380
exoplanets to look at that may be habitable.

76
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.660
What are the main ones that researchers are

77
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.420
hoping to look at with JWST?

78
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.560
Well, apart from TRAPPIST-1, which is the

79
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.440
sort of ideal because it's so close, it's

80
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.200
only 41 light-years away, it has these

81
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.820
seven Earth-sized planets.

82
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.940
And as such, it makes a sort of

83
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.140
ideal laboratory for astronomers to look at habitability

84
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.740
because they've got a whole collection of planets

85
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.660
of different temperatures because they're all different distances

86
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.500
from the star.

87
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.140
So they can see how temperature and their

88
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.840
different orbits affect their possible habitability.

89
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.020
You could look at different sorts of planets

90
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.640
other than small and rocky.

91
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.380
The slightly larger planets, you could have water

92
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.780
worlds.

93
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.200
There's one particular one that is again quite

94
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.540
close to Earth, which is called LHS 1140

95
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.840
b.

96
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.760
It's about 1.7 times larger than Earth.

97
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.740
There's an even larger planet, which is called

98
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.820
K2-18 b, which is more like Neptune

99
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.240
than it is like Earth.

100
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.640
It's got a thick atmosphere, which is going

101
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.080
to be principally hydrogen.

102
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.740
Planets are formed with hydrogen, but if they're

103
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.240
small, hydrogen just boils away because it's very

104
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.800
volatile.

105
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.920
But a bigger planet can hold onto the

106
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.160
hydrogen.

107
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.900
Observing a large planet like that with a

108
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.060
thick atmosphere is easier for JWST to do

109
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.960
because the signal of the light coming through

110
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.860
the atmosphere is going to be stronger.

111
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.760
So some people say we should be looking

112
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.600
at large planets like that because your chances

113
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.640
of getting a positive signal are greater.

114
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.260
The planets that are in the TRAPPIST-1

115
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.560
system, they're similar to us in size, right?

116
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.960
What are kind of the factors that are

117
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.260
making not only an exoplanet interesting to observe,

118
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.980
but what makes them good specifically for JWST

119
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.640
to get interesting results from?

120
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.320
Despite, you know, the great power of JWST,

121
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.500
if they look at a system like TRAPPIST

122
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.560
-1, they can't actually see the planets themselves.

123
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.960
The glare of a star is still too

124
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.000
great, and the distance between the planet and

125
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.340
the star is too small for even a

126
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.880
big telescope like JWST to separate them.

127
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.140
So what you have to do is look

128
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.220
at how the light from the whole system

129
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.140
changes, and that works particularly well if you're

130
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.760
looking at the system edge-on.

131
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.740
So you're seeing the planets move around the

132
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.860
star, and they pass in front of the

133
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.720
star, so they're blocking a little bit of

134
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.480
its light, and some of that starlight is

135
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.920
coming through their atmosphere.

136
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.960
And also when they move behind the star,

137
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.820
suddenly the light from the planet is disappearing.

138
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.780
And so by comparing the light from the

139
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.680
whole system with the light when the planet

140
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.660
is suddenly gone, you can subtract one from

141
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.300
the other and get the signal that is

142
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.600
just coming from the planet.

143
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.540
So those are the two techniques that astronomers

144
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.440
are using.

145
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.880
A transit, when it goes across the front,

146
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.500
and the other technique is watching it disappear

147
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.900
behind the star and seeing what disappears.

148
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.320
Edge-on planetary systems are key to studying

149
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.120
exoplanets, but also closeness to Earth.

150
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.640
If you go very much further away, it

151
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.040
gets much, much more difficult, and you have

152
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.120
to use a lot of telescope time to

153
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.220
get the same information.

154
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.160
Telescope time is very precious.

155
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.420
It seems like, okay, there's seven planets, maybe

156
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.420
they would have been able to take a

157
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.080
look at everything by now, but that's definitely

158
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.000
not the case.

159
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.740
They have not looked at every single planet

160
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.080
in the TRAPPIST-1 system.

161
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.040
So the two that they've looked at so

162
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.280
far, have the results been promising there, or

163
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.120
were they expecting to see an atmosphere or

164
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.840
potentially anything habitable?

165
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.380
Yeah, well, they looked at the two nearest

166
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.280
to the star, which are called B and

167
00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.600
C.

168
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.700
They didn't find any evidence of an atmosphere,

169
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.320
or at least not a thick atmosphere.

170
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.100
It's possible that TRAPPIST-1C might have something

171
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.760
very much thinner than is on Earth, and

172
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.700
we can't detect it yet, but those results

173
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.800
were a bit disappointing.

174
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.500
They have looked at most of the others

175
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.420
very briefly, and again, they couldn't detect an

176
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.540
atmosphere, but what they did discover is that

177
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.500
the star is making their job much harder.

178
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.020
Ideally, you would have a star that was

179
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.220
just given a steady backlight for your observations,

180
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.860
but actually the star has a lot of

181
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.740
sunspots and flares, and that complicates the data

182
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.880
you're trying to get about the planet, because

183
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.000
you've got to disentangle this sort of variability

184
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.720
of the star from the variability of the

185
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.120
planet, and that's forcing astronomers to come up

186
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.460
with new techniques to try and separate those

187
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.140
two signals.

188
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.440
So do they think it's going to be

189
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.620
possible to separate it, or could it potentially

190
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.200
not be possible, in which case we aren't

191
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.460
going to get any sort of clear answer

192
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.200
on anything in the TRAPPIST-1 system?

193
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.680
Well, you know, they're clever people.

194
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.020
They're coming up with new things.

195
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.180
In the third year of observing, which is

196
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.880
just about to start, they're testing in one

197
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.520
of these techniques where they're looking at two

198
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.580
of the planets around TRAPPIST-1, planet B

199
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.860
and planet E.

200
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.900
Since they now know that B has no

201
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.780
atmosphere, they're looking at these two planets, which

202
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.860
transit the front of the star in quick

203
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.380
succession.

204
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.020
So they know B is going to produce

205
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.520
a spectrum with no atmosphere, and then they

206
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.860
can compare that to when E transits across,

207
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.340
which when the star won't have changed very

208
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.880
much, and E, they hope, has an atmosphere.

209
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.660
So any differences between those two spectra, hopefully,

210
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.120
will be signs coming from the atmosphere of

211
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.280
TRAPPIST-1E.

212
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.320
That's the plan.

213
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.000
But it's going to take a lot of

214
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.160
transits over the next two years to get

215
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.880
enough information to see that signal.

216
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.420
And how many times is it transiting in

217
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.100
a view that we can see per year?

218
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.560
It's a lot more than our Earth, right?

219
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.700
All of those planets, the longest orbit is

220
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.640
less than three weeks.

221
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.880
So they're all making quite quick orbits around

222
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.440
the star.

223
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.880
But just because of the orientation of the

224
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.540
telescope and so on, you can't, you know,

225
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.660
look at them all the time.

226
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.160
This little experiment of comparing planet E and

227
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.100
planet B, they're going to do it 15

228
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.860
times over the next two years.

229
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.100
And hopefully that'll give them enough signal.

230
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.160
They'll be able to discern something of an

231
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.280
atmosphere above the noise of the star.

232
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.840
This is going to be done over the

233
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.080
course of two years.

234
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.380
When it comes to looking at those planets

235
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.700
in the TRAPPIST-1 system that are a

236
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.320
little further from the M dwarf, how much

237
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.580
longer is it going to take to observe

238
00:09:59.580 --> 00:09:59.880
that?

239
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.220
To one, get an answer of does it

240
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:01.820
have an atmosphere?

241
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.780
But then additionally to that, what's actually in

242
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.280
the atmosphere?

243
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.140
So looking at lots of transits, I've seen

244
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.000
estimates of over 100 hours of observing.

245
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.580
So many, many, many transits to get a

246
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.020
detection of carbon dioxide.

247
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.400
So that's a molecule they think probably exists

248
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.560
around these sorts of planets.

249
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.200
And it has a very strong signal that

250
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.700
JWST in particular can pick up.

251
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.480
Could you put into context 100 hours in

252
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:31.900
a year?

253
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.040
How much time is that from all of

254
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.960
the time that JWST has to observe?

255
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.500
In a whole year, it has 10,000

256
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:38.940
hours.

257
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.940
A lot of that goes to completely unrelated

258
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.920
sorts of science.

259
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.360
Of those 10,000 hours, about 30%

260
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.520
is typically spent on exoplanets.

261
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.520
And that's all different sorts of exoplanets.

262
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.100
So the amount of time spent actually looking

263
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.780
at TRAPPIST-1 is maybe a couple or

264
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.060
3% of the total time.

265
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.640
But still, that is dozens or hundreds of

266
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:06.980
hours.

267
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.660
It's a small chunk of what JWST does,

268
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.820
but everyone wants to use JWST.  So there's

269
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.720
a lot of competition.

270
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.920
Of the people you talk to, what are

271
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.540
kind of the main ideas that people think

272
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.440
we should be investing in right now to

273
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.140
find these habitable zones?

274
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.460
A lot of people think TRAPPIST-1 is

275
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.740
what we should be focusing on because it's

276
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.380
so close.

277
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.840
It has so many planets.

278
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.720
The Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates JWST,

279
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.080
they're donating 500 hours over the next year

280
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.260
to sort of widen this search.

281
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.860
And so astronomers have suggested what they should

282
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.100
do is just look at 15 to 20

283
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.780
other systems where there's a known Earth-sized

284
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.860
planet and just see whether there's an atmosphere

285
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.080
around it.

286
00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.240
These other planets, are they also similarly orbiting

287
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.380
around these more turbulent M-dwarfs, or are

288
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.540
they like in very sort of different systems?

289
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.300
Typically, they would be around M-dwarfs because

290
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.280
you have this issue of not having a

291
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.840
star that's too bright, which would just, you

292
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.020
know, overwhelm the signal from the planet.

293
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.740
When this type of star, M-dwarfs, are

294
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.000
young, they're particularly turbulent and they blast out

295
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.160
a lot of X-rays and extreme ultraviolet

296
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.540
light.

297
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.240
It could just boil the atmospheres away.

298
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.520
And so these Earth-like planets very close

299
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.740
to that star could have nothing.

300
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.340
They could just be bare rocks.

301
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.260
We don't know.

302
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.500
And that's why the search is so intense

303
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.320
at the moment, just to find out whether

304
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.080
some of these atmospheres survive.

305
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.120
If it turns out that it's unlikely that

306
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.280
there will be an atmosphere around an M

307
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.700
-dwarf, then what other types of planets could

308
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.900
potentially be habitable?

309
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.900
People have done a lot of atmospheric modeling,

310
00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.260
so taking what they think the ingredients of

311
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.620
a planet will be and playing around with

312
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.400
the parameters to see what atmosphere it might

313
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.500
have, whether it would have oceans.

314
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.680
There have been a lot of suggestions that

315
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.240
you might have water worlds, an ocean that

316
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.720
just covers the entire planet.

317
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.440
And that, you know, could be a habitable

318
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.180
exoplanet.

319
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.180
It might not have anything that looks like

320
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.840
us on it, but it could have microorganisms

321
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.060
that thrive in the global ocean.

322
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.700
When we're thinking about biosignatures that would be

323
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.780
present in an atmosphere that has life, we're

324
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.680
obviously thinking about our own planet.

325
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.880
But I guess if it were a water

326
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.640
world, could it potentially have different biosignatures or

327
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.980
what could we expect to look for that

328
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.340
would indicate there's life there?

329
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.240
The whole subject of biosignatures is very tricky

330
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.780
because we only have one planet with life

331
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.160
on it.

332
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.660
We have life growing in hot springs or

333
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.280
hydrothermal vents deeper under the ocean where there's

334
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.240
no light, but they're getting heat from hot

335
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.460
brine coming up from beneath the seabed.

336
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.120
So we know that life can live in

337
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.260
all sorts of bizarre situations, but viewing an

338
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.460
exoplanet from tens or hundreds of light years

339
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.820
away, trying to discern that is very, very

340
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.180
difficult.

341
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.580
What you're looking for is an atmosphere that's

342
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.860
in disequilibrium.

343
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.020
So it's in a state that you can't

344
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.080
explain how it could maintain itself in that

345
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.480
state unless there was a biological mechanism going

346
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.400
on in that planet.

347
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.160
What JWST can do is find the planets

348
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.720
that have the right physical conditions, the right

349
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.760
temperature, liquid water, enough light getting to the

350
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.600
surface, all of those things that life might

351
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.100
need.

352
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.320
That's the sort of thing you can discern

353
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.260
with JWST, but actually spotting whether life is

354
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.660
there may have to wait for the next

355
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.040
telescope.

356
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.760
Are there plans for any other telescopes that

357
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.960
could potentially gather this information?

358
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.900
Yeah, there are.

359
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.680
NASA, you know, it's very, very early stages,

360
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.660
but they are looking at a larger telescope,

361
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.260
which is going to be called the Habitable

362
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.700
Worlds Observatory.

363
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.480
That sounds very targeted to look for this

364
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.920
stuff, Ben.

365
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.240
Exactly, exactly.

366
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.140
Which would be similar to JWST in that

367
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.440
it has a folding mirror, but it would

368
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.800
be larger and it would probably look at

369
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.980
different wavelengths, might be optical light rather than

370
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.380
infrared.

371
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.380
But other people are also looking at the

372
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.980
possibility of having a sort of a flotilla

373
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.560
of separate telescopes.

374
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.600
If you have several telescopes flying in formations

375
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.840
hundreds or thousands of kilometers apart and you

376
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.460
combine their light through a process called interferometry,

377
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.800
you get a very, very detailed image, you

378
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.400
know, as if you had a telescope that

379
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.360
was as wide as those telescopes are separated.

380
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.240
So, say they were 100 kilometers apart, it

381
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.760
would be like you had a 100-kilometer

382
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.280
telescope.

383
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.400
Wow, that's cool.

384
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.700
Yeah, so it doesn't gather as much light

385
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.100
as 100 kilometers, but it has the resolution,

386
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.660
the fineness of detail.

387
00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.740
And with something like that, you might be

388
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.740
able to zoom in on an exoplanet and

389
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.840
see whether it has areas of ocean and

390
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.300
areas of continent or cloud cover or ice

391
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.920
caps, things that we would recognize in an

392
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.200
image of a planet in our solar system.

393
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.120
That requires very sophisticated technology we don't yet

394
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.060
have, but people are working on it.

395
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.220
Working on the designs of how you would

396
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.640
achieve that sort of telescope.

397
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.600
Part of the job of JWST is to

398
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.260
beat a path for the next telescope to

399
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.580
have an even closer look.

400
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.720
Thank you so much, Dan.

401
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.520
My pleasure.

407
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.900
Stay tuned for a chat with producer Ariana

408
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.540
Remmel and Ava Fannerstill about why a warming

409
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.359
world could worsen air pollution.

410
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.510
Photochemical smog is a notoriously noxious form of

411
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.270
air pollution that blankets the landscape in a

412
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.210
complex concoction of ozone and aerosols.

413
00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.690
And it's a health risk that's all too

414
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.849
familiar to denizens of megacities like Los Angeles,

415
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.450
California, where gas-powered motor vehicles generate some

416
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.670
of the toxic chemicals that react to form

417
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.070
smog, such as volatile organic compounds called VOCs.

418
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.190
After decades of air quality regulations, VOC emissions

419
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.170
from cars and other anthropogenic sources have declined.

420
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.890
Yet Angelenos are still plagued by the hazardous

421
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.050
haze, especially during the hot summer months.

422
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.450
This week in science, Ava Fannerstill and colleagues

423
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.570
wrote about an overlooked source of volatile organic

424
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.870
compounds and why that matters for urban planning

425
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.010
in a warming world.

426
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.790
Welcome to the science podcast, Ava.

427
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.430
Hi, thanks for having me.

428
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.470
So urban air pollution is a hot topic

429
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.850
in atmospheric chemistry, especially in California.

430
00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.290
I understand that you did this research while

431
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.290
you were a postdoc at UC Berkeley.

432
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.010
Did you ever experience air pollution from photochemical

433
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.250
smog or other sources while you lived in

434
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:17.790
the Bay Area?

435
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.110
Yeah, in the summer months when I was

436
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.830
living in Berkeley, there often were spare the

437
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.570
air alerts that told us to stay inside

438
00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.450
and don't drive and things like that because

439
00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.390
there was dangerous photochemical smog.

440
00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.510
So yeah, it happened.

441
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.810
Although air pollution is much more of a

442
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.330
problem in Los Angeles than in the Bay

443
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.590
Area.

444
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.290
Certainly, there are many things that we know

445
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.650
about what causes smog.

446
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.370
What was the data gap that you were

447
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.890
trying to address in this particular study?

448
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.550
We were trying to find out, on the

449
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.410
one hand, why air pollution in Los Angeles

450
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.730
is temperature dependent.

451
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.810
I mean, of course, the chemistry goes faster

452
00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.130
when temperatures are hotter.

453
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.890
So that's one part of the explanation that

454
00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.530
is already known.

455
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.730
But that's the other part of, might also

456
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.710
the emissions change when it gets hotter and

457
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.250
the composition of emissions change.

458
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.710
And the other question was, why has air

459
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.190
pollution stagnated for at least the last decade

460
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.210
or so and not gotten better?

461
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.930
Although our cars are getting cleaner with all

462
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.510
the regulations that are in place.

463
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.890
There is a lot of chemistry that goes

464
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.750
on in the atmosphere.

465
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.690
You pointed specifically to volatile organic compounds.

466
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.230
Can you tell me a little bit more

467
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:29.330
about what those compounds are and the other

468
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.130
chemical players that are contributing to this type

469
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:32.690
of air pollution?

470
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.410
Yeah.

471
00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.850
So you all know volatile organic compounds because

472
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.530
many of them are fragrant.

473
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:40.650
So you can smell them.

474
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.730
For example, the smell of a pine forest

475
00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.370
or the smell of your perfume or also

476
00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.130
bad smells.

477
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.030
All those are usually volatile organic compounds.

478
00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.570
And they are present in the atmosphere in

479
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.830
very, very low levels and parts per billion

480
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:54.690
levels and below.

481
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.950
Despite that, they are really important for our

482
00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.090
atmospheric chemistry because they are so reactive, they

483
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.490
can contribute to the formation of air pollutants.

484
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.870
Some examples would be terpenes that come out

485
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.010
of plants and that create, for example, this

486
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.410
nice pine smell or lemon smell is also

487
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:10.910
a terpene.

488
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.030
And then you also have typical traffic emissions

489
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.930
like benzene that is also by itself already

490
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:17.870
a cancerous VOC.

491
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.770
So how exactly are these VOCs reacting to

492
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.890
form ozone and aerosols?

493
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.570
Yeah.

494
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.590
So for that, you need sunlight.

495
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.910
And with the sunlight in the atmosphere, you

496
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.050
create radicals that then react very rapidly with

497
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.610
the reactive VOCs.

498
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.230
This reaction forms over a reaction chain on

499
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.490
the one hand particles because to oxidize them,

500
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.630
they get heavier and at some point they

501
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.370
can stick together.

502
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.530
And become really aerosol particles.

503
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.290
And when you inhale them, that creates a

504
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:49.770
health problem.

505
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.150
On the other hand, if you also have

506
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.690
nitrogen oxides from cars present in the atmosphere,

507
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.030
then this reaction also forms ozone.

508
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.690
So the bad ozone that's close to us

509
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.490
at the surface, not the good ozone that

510
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.790
protects us from UV light in the stratosphere.

511
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.390
And the bad ozone, if we inhale it

512
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.730
also is really bad for our lungs.

513
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.410
It also damages plant tissue.

514
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.930
So it reduces harvests and so on.

515
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.810
For that form, you need the combustion of

516
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.810
fossil fuel emissions that form nitrogen oxides.

517
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.470
And these then together with the VOCs form

518
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.890
the ozone.

519
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.930
So we know that VOCs contribute to air

520
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:28.330
pollution.

521
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.370
And we know that emissions from traffic have

522
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.210
declined over the last few decades.

523
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.090
So what are we missing here?

524
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.570
Yeah, that was exactly the question that we

525
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.550
posed in our study.

526
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.090
And that is why we equipped a small

527
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.770
aircraft with really high-tech instrumentation that can

528
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.010
measure hundreds of VOCs at the same time.

529
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.410
And not just measure the VOC concentrations, but

530
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:56.670
also directly measure emissions by a complex method

531
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.890
that we call airborne eddy covariance.

532
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.390
For that, we also need really high-speed

533
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.030
wind measurements.

534
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.550
And by combining these concentration measurements with the

535
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.290
wind measurements, we can then calculate emission fluxes.

536
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.670
So we can directly quantify how much is

537
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.310
emitted per area and time in a certain

538
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.070
location that we're flying over.

539
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.810
And doing that for hundreds of VOCs at

540
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.550
the same time then, of course, helps us

541
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.570
to find out what is emitted where and

542
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.950
which might be VOC species that have been

543
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:27.450
overlooked in the past or underestimated in the

544
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.090
emission models.

545
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.370
Tell me a little bit more about this

546
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.910
aircraft and, like, what taking these measurements actually

547
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:33.570
looked like.

548
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.250
Yeah, so this aircraft, it's a twin otter

549
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.350
propeller aircraft, really small.

550
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.930
You can't really stand up in there.

551
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.610
There were two pilots, two scientists, and then

552
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.170
space for three or four scientific instruments.

553
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.290
And we were flying at a thousand feet

554
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.070
altitude over Los Angeles.

555
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.090
So it's really low, not a usual aircraft

556
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.050
altitude that you are allowed to fly at.

557
00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.930
And we got actually a lot of trouble

558
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.510
because in Los Angeles, there were lots of

559
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.710
airports and you fly from one tower airspace

560
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.390
into the next one every five minutes.

561
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.850
So our pilots had to do a lot

562
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.450
of talking with all these towers to explain

563
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.770
them what we're doing and that we do

564
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.450
not want to be diverted from our route

565
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.490
because it's also important to fly at the

566
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.370
same altitude, straight lines to do these measurements.

567
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.750
Since it was summer in Los Angeles and

568
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.110
we were flying really close to the surface,

569
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.290
it also got quite hot in the aircraft.

570
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:28.570
It didn't have any air conditioning.

571
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.370
We had to cool one of our instruments.

572
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.070
So my colleague had to lie down on

573
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.990
the aircraft floor and put ice packs on

574
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.470
the instrument to keep it from shutting down.

575
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.530
So, yeah, we were lucky it didn't happen

576
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.190
because then we would have lost a lot

577
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.510
of data.

578
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.450
Oh, my goodness.

579
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.590
That is certainly a demonstration of your dedication

580
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.670
to this project.

581
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.010
So with all of the effort that went

582
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.170
into taking these measurements, what did you actually

583
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:50.710
find?

584
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.790
We did these kinds of flights at different

585
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:54.310
temperatures.

586
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.190
So we flew patterns over Los Angeles or

587
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.390
let's say the greater Los Angeles basin.

588
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.210
That way we were able to map emissions

589
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.170
and compare them with emission models, but also

590
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.610
to see how these emissions depend on temperature.

591
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.170
And what we found was that temperature-dependent

592
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:17.490
emissions comprise the major part of the air

593
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.550
pollutant formation from these emissions.

594
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.450
So the temperature-dependent part of the emissions

595
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.790
is the biggest chunk of what contributes to

596
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.390
ozone formation and particle formation.

597
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.330
And that was kind of surprising because the

598
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.230
typical traffic emissions are not temperature dependent.

599
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.690
So it's really other sources that are doing

600
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.010
this.

601
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.550
And we found that a big part of

602
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.610
that is terpenes coming from plants mostly.

603
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.170
I mean, there's also terpenes and lots of

604
00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:50.010
fragrance products that contribute, but a big part

605
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.810
of it must be plants because it's so

606
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:52.950
strongly temperature dependent.

607
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.570
And another result was also that some human

608
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.990
-made emissions, so anthropogenic emissions, are also temperature

609
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.410
dependent.

610
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.010
For example, solvents, which makes sense physically, they

611
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.950
evaporate more when it gets hotter.

612
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.470
But this was not yet considered in emission

613
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.850
models.

614
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.910
So I understand that heat helps to speed

615
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.970
up chemical reactions.

616
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.470
That makes sense that VOCs that are already

617
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.830
present are going to be on the fast

618
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.590
track to making some of these pollutants.

619
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:23.910
Why are the plants making more terpenes in

620
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:24.370
the heat?

621
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.030
Help me understand that element of this.

622
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.610
Yeah.

623
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.610
So it's actually a well-known fact that

624
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.550
plant emissions depend on temperature.

625
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.090
So the hotter it gets, the more they

626
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.370
emit.

627
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.170
Why they actually do that is not entirely

628
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:35.490
known.

629
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:36.730
There are different theories.

630
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.670
So they might be protecting their tissues from

631
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.150
reactive oxygen species.

632
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:46.330
They might also be protecting themselves against oxidants

633
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:50.030
like ozone, because then the ozone reacts away

634
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.290
with the terpenes that they emit.

635
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.810
And they, of course, also sometimes use terpenes

636
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.150
to communicate with each other.

637
00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.290
And under stress, these emissions can even increase

638
00:25:59.290 --> 00:25:59.550
more.

639
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.470
So then it can be orders of magnitude

640
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.690
higher than what you would expect from the

641
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.850
normal temperature dependence.

642
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.150
And I guess if terpenes are also some

643
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.430
of the molecules that are associated with fragrances,

644
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.170
it kind of makes sense that summer and

645
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.790
spring, when plants are flowering, there might also

646
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:15.550
be more terpenes.

647
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:16.090
Is that right?

648
00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.270
Yeah, that's correct.

649
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.430
I mean, we cannot really distinguish where our

650
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.210
terpenes came from, but certainly when we were

651
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.290
flying, we saw that huge areas in Los

652
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.970
Angeles had these flowering jacaranda trees.

653
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.010
So many streets were purple, which looked really

654
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.970
beautiful from the plane perspective.

655
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.310
And the flowering can cause orders of magnitude

656
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.010
higher emissions compared to normal situations as well.

657
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.450
So that could certainly have been a contributor.

658
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.830
OK, so what I'm hearing here is that

659
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.210
the terpenes emitted by plants might actually be

660
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.890
an overlooked source of follicle organic compounds that

661
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.230
are contributing to air pollution.

662
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.610
But I don't think the solution is to,

663
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.430
like, cut down all the trees, right?

664
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.330
I mean, there are some really clear benefits

665
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.330
to having green spaces in cities.

666
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.890
But climate change projections are telling us that

667
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.450
summers are going to get hotter, that extreme

668
00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.650
weather events like heat waves are going to

669
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:10.650
become more frequent.

670
00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.330
So did your research point to other strategies

671
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.030
that we might be able to try to

672
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.910
compensate for the fact that these plants naturally

673
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.710
emit more terpenes in the heat?

674
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.770
Yeah, absolutely.

675
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.250
So, yeah, of course, it's not a solution

676
00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.510
to get rid of the trees in our

677
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.710
cities because they provide shade, they improve local

678
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.190
climate.

679
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.370
They are really important.

680
00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:34.010
Now, what is important to consider is that

681
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.890
what you need for ozone formation from these

682
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.830
VOCs that are emitted by the plants is

683
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.650
also nitrogen oxides that are emitted by the

684
00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:42.690
burning of fossil fuels.

685
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.350
So if you get rid of the fossil

686
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.450
fuel use, then you also get rid of

687
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.810
the ozone.

688
00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.890
So reducing our use of fossil fuels for

689
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.010
powering our cars and our electricity has many

690
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:56.470
benefits.

691
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.810
So it will not only reduce the temperature

692
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.250
increase that increases then the terpene emissions, but

693
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.710
it will also locally reduce the air production

694
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.690
because you need to get rid of the

695
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.890
nitrogen oxides and then your plant emissions are

696
00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.570
no longer a problem for ozone.

697
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.590
Another point is also since we cannot really

698
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.230
regulate the emissions from trees, what we can

699
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.330
regulate is the anthropogenic part of the emissions.

700
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.610
So as we saw in our study, some

701
00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.690
anthropogenic parts of the emissions are also temperature

702
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.610
dependent like solvents and this whole part of

703
00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.870
solvents and household chemicals has not been very

704
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.150
much regulated in the past.

705
00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.690
So I think there's also quite a lot

706
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.230
to gain in looking at how these chemicals

707
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.310
impact air pollution.

708
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.870
And last but not least, of course, when

709
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.570
you do urban greening in your city and

710
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.230
plant trees, you can, apart from other factors,

711
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.750
of course, like how is your tree adapted

712
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.870
to the local climate and how much shade

713
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:50.570
does it need to create?

714
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.630
One factor should also be how much VOCs

715
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:54.270
does it emit?

716
00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.850
There are some species that emit more VOCs

717
00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:57.330
than others.

718
00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.890
So that can certainly be a factor to

719
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:03.330
consider to enhance air quality in our cities.

720
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.790
This is such fascinating research.
