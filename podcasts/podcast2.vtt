of Medicine at Mount Sinai, one of America's

3
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.300
leading research medical schools.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.480
Icahn Mount Sinai is the academic arm of

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.820
the eight-hospital Mount Sinai Health System in

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.320
New York City.

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.800
It's consistently among the top recipients of NIH

funding.

9
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.800
Researchers at Icahn Mount Sinai have made breakthrough

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.620
discoveries in many fields vital to advancing the

11
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.460
health of patients, including cancer, COVID and long

12
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.640
COVID, cardiology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.760
We find a way.

15
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.510
This is the Science Podcast for May 22nd,

16
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.250
2024.

17
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.510
I'm Sarah Crespi.

18
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.870
First up, hope in the field of deadly

19
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.670
prion diseases.

20
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.710
Prions are these misfolded proteins that clump together

21
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.350
and chew holes in the brain.

22
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.860
The misfolding of these normal proteins can be

23
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.480
in a number of ways.

24
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.500
Genetics, spontaneous folding, and infection with a misfolded

25
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.720
prion from another animal or person.

26
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.840
Staff writer Meredith Wadman walks me through new

27
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.220
potential treatments for these always fatal neurodegenerative diseases.

28
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.300
Next up on the show, producer Katherine Irving

29
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.220
talks with researcher Ashley Larson about the effects

30
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.520
of organic farms on their neighbors.

31
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.600
If there are very few organic farms, conventional

32
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.680
farms actually tend to increase their pesticide use.

33
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.040
But if organic farms are clustered together, the

34
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.500
pesticide use goes down for everyone.

35
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.180
Prion diseases have a very strange mechanism.

36
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.180
Prions start as a normal protein with a

37
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.840
normal function in the brain.

38
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.860
These prions can misfold or adopt another shape

39
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.500
and then cause other prion proteins to also

40
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.020
misfold.

41
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.860
These misfolded proteins accumulate and slowly, surely destroy

42
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.280
the brain.

43
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.540
Neurodegenerative prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob in humans

44
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.440
and bovine spongiform encephalitis in cows can actually

45
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.420
infect others in certain circumstances.

46
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.160
Like you might have to eat part of

47
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.760
the cow and there are also certain ways

48
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.360
for humans to pass this to another.

49
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.820
No matter which way you get it, there's

50
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.940
also genetic versions, it's 100% fatal.

51
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.200
Attempts to find treatments for prion diseases have

52
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.600
really been stymied since the discovery of these

53
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.440
mechanisms in the 1980s.

54
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.960
But this week in science, staff writer Meredith

55
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.780
Wadman wrote about new tactics to take on

56
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.080
prion diseases that are giving hope to researchers

57
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.040
and patients.

58
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.240
Hi Meredith, welcome back to the podcast.

59
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.920
Hi Sarah, I'm glad to be here.

60
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.040
Yeah, I'm happy to have you, although this

61
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.560
is a pretty intense story.

62
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.660
You have a lot of people that you

63
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.620
talk to that are either had this disease

64
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.860
or studying this disease because they have family

65
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.540
or enrolled in the trials.

66
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.820
It's an impactful piece for sure.

67
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.140
In fact, I first heard of this story

68
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.060
on the Science Slack channel four months ago.

69
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.520
You wrote on there, my friend is having

70
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.640
these really weird symptoms.

71
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.220
He's in the hospital.

72
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.680
Do you want me to read your Slack

73
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.020
message?

74
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.760
Would that be weird?

75
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.280
Sure, yeah, no.

76
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.700
Okay, do you want to read it or

77
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.700
you Okay, so I see the Slack message

78
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.500
from you on one of the new Slack

79
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.780
channels.

80
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.020
For any of you disease sleuths out there,

81
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.980
a personal question.

82
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.800
We have a good friend, 67 years old

83
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.260
in Arlington Hospital since Sunday, with progressively worsening

84
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.060
confusion, now hallucinating.

85
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.880
He has left-sided weakness.

86
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.080
His MRI shows something going on in the

87
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.560
right temporal lobe, no recent travel.

88
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.340
His last travel was to England in March.

89
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.760
In a stretch, the stump doctors are testing

90
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.620
for CJD.

91
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.560
They have also just requested a neuro consult

92
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.560
from the Mayo Clinic.

93
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.720
I asked if they have tested him for

94
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.900
eastern equine encephalitis, WNV, rocky mountain spotted fever,

95
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.940
herpes simplex, cryptococcus.

96
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.780
Is there anything I'm missing?

97
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.440
I didn't ask about malaria.

98
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.740
There was recently a case in Maryland.

99
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.540
So this is you reaching out to our

100
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.700
science news staffers who have explored all aspects

101
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.300
of disease and biology and saying, who can

102
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.140
help me figure out what's going on with

103
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.519
my friend?

104
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.040
And of course, it turns out it was

105
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.839
the super unlikely CJD, which is a prion

106
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.300
disease.

107
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.800
It was, and I got to correct myself,

108
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.640
my Slack message in two elements.

109
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.660
Number one, Charlie was 70, not 67.

110
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.120
Yeah.

111
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.460
And number two, my sort of know-it

112
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.540
-all-ish saying, in a stretch, they're thinking

113
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.520
about CJD.

114
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.020
And of course, you think about what you

115
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.360
know.

116
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.560
And even as a medical student years ago,

117
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.340
CJD was so rare.

118
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.740
Like it is rare as a physician that

119
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.320
you will see a case in your life.

120
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.680
Yeah.

121
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.320
So I was kind of like, what?

122
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.920
It's not easy to diagnose, right?

123
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.480
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, what we're talking about.

124
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.240
It's a prion disease.

125
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.740
It's one of the human forms.

126
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.440
It's not easy to diagnose.

127
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.440
It's very rare.

128
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.700
Like people are not coming down with this.

129
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.400
And the only way to tell often is

130
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.120
in aftermath, right?

131
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.160
Oh, the only definitive diagnosis is from a

132
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.260
pathology in a brain autopsy.

133
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.660
So yeah, that's the for-sure method.

134
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.100
Although there's some very good diagnostic tools, one

135
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.740
in particular now that give a lot of

136
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.200
certainty.

137
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.260
But that's not going to change the course

138
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.180
of the disease, which in almost all cases

139
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.860
is very rapidly progressive.

140
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.660
Our friend Charlie died about five weeks after

141
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.320
he showed the very first symptoms.

142
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.040
Yeah.

143
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.680
Was that what made you decide to write

144
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.240
this story?

145
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.360
Certainly got it on my radar.

146
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.520
And then in discussing with one of our

147
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.820
editors, John Travis, what was going on, because

148
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.820
this has been a uniformly bleak field for

149
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.180
having treatments, there are none.

150
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.040
He and I kind of came across several

151
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.080
potential treatments that are progressing.

152
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.520
Yeah.

153
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.400
And one just happened to be launching the

154
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.680
first clinical trial in more than a dozen

155
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.580
years started in January.

156
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.580
So it seemed like an auspicious time to

157
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.560
be writing about this.

158
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.880
There are different sources of prion disease.

159
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.620
So for example, I mentioned the cow form

160
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.260
was transferred to people through diet in England

161
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.440
during this huge outbreak.

162
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.880
But nowadays, how are people getting prion diseases?

163
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.800
How can someone end up with this kind

164
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.780
of misfolding protein accumulating in their brain?

165
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.420
Right.

166
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.660
So if you think about all prion disease

167
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.260
as pie, there's a tiny sliver, less than

168
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.880
1% that is acquired by eating contaminated

169
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.840
meat or by having a surgery, a neurosurgery

170
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.120
in which a contaminated instrument was used.

171
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.640
Something external to your body comes into it.

172
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.460
The case we heard about a researcher in

173
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.080
France in the last couple of years who

174
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.200
had a needle stick from working with prion

175
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.740
proteins.

176
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.480
Right.

177
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.180
Exactly.

178
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.980
Super rare.

179
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.320
The whole pie is ultra rare.

180
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.900
It's a bunch of ultra rare diseases or

181
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.540
super rare.

182
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.900
Yeah.

183
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.920
And the acquired kind is like less than

184
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.140
1%.

185
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.420
So and just to put it in context,

186
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.160
in the U.S. there have been four

187
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.960
cases of acquired from infected cattle disease ever

188
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.920
since the British outbreak.

189
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.880
And three of those had traveled abroad.

190
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.260
Yeah.

191
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.940
And one of them possibly had traveled, they

192
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.880
had picked it up traveling.

193
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.020
So this is not something homegrown where you

194
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.720
got to look at U.S. cattle say

195
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.140
and say, ooh, I better not.

196
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.720
Right.

197
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.420
So what do we have left in this

198
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.720
pie?

199
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.800
So 10 to 15% of the pie

200
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.680
is genetically acquired prion disease.

201
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.500
That's where you inherit a mutation.

202
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.520
And these are dominant mutations, which means that

203
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.180
if your parent is carrying the mutation, you

204
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.720
have a 50% chance of getting it

205
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.240
from them.

206
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.800
And then if you do inherit it, you

207
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.740
have a 100% chance of developing the

208
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.120
disease.

209
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.120
It's not a matter of if, but when.

210
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.780
Then finally, you have these 85% or

211
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.080
90% of people who just develop it.

212
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.340
They call it sporadically.

213
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.740
Consider it spontaneously.

214
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.320
This protein goes rogue.

215
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.960
That's much more likely to be in people

216
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.760
over 60.

217
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.960
So related with aging, perhaps it's not well

218
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.060
understood why these proteins, regular normal prion proteins,

219
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.140
which inhabit all of our brains, suddenly just

220
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.960
misfold and go berserk and basically chew holes

221
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.520
in the brain.

222
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.920
How easy is it to study interventions in

223
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.820
this population?

224
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.520
You know, you have your people who have

225
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.620
the spontaneous form.

226
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.980
You have your very small slice of genetically

227
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.100
predisposed.

228
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.360
How do you enroll people in a clinical

229
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.100
trial if they're already kind of on their

230
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.360
way in a short, short-term disease to

231
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.640
death?

232
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.380
Right.

233
00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.240
So that is a key hurdle.

234
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.120
One clinical trial that just launched in January,

235
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.320
the first one in more than a dozen

236
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.740
years, that is randomly assigned, very carefully controlled,

237
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.240
the kind of trial that produces evidence that

238
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.500
FDA would look at and say, yes, we'll

239
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.180
prove this or not.

240
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.300
It's the first stage.

241
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.720
But the company, Ionis, that developed this drug

242
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.460
hopes to be able to win an FDA

243
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:05.920
approval.

244
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.140
But they're testing it in people with acute

245
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.740
disease at this time.

246
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.220
And so they have a small window to

247
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.100
find these people.

248
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.220
People bounce around from doctor to doctor.

249
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.460
No one knows what's happening.

250
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.880
The symptoms look odd.

251
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.380
Doctors haven't seen this, by and large.

252
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.520
And it's really tricky to diagnose.

253
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.580
So by the time there's a presumptive diagnosis,

254
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.320
there may be only weeks left for that

255
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.140
patient to live.

256
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.620
And so you've got to get them enrolled

257
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.480
in that trial very quickly.

258
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.640
The medium survival time for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,

259
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.120
the most common of these prion diseases, is

260
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.960
four to six months.

261
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.000
So the clinical trial that we're talking about

262
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.880
here that's kicking off is using basically the

263
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.500
fact that this is starting as DNA, going

264
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.480
to mRNA, and then going to protein and

265
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.280
trying to interfere in that process by introducing

266
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.140
an antisense oligonucleotide.

267
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.120
So a little strip of DNA that will

268
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.180
go and find the RNA before it gets

269
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.320
turned into the protein.

270
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.760
That's exactly it.

271
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.080
Antisense oligonucleotide, ASO for short.

272
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.280
And how does it get into the brain?

273
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.540
It is injected into the spinal fluid near

274
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.600
the base of the spine.

275
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.940
And that fluid is contiguous with the brain.

276
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.160
It bathes it and it goes into systems

277
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.000
inside the brain.

278
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.380
And then the ASO is believed to track

279
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.960
along the small arteries and get into the

280
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.520
brain tissue.

281
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.400
There's a question about how deep.

282
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.000
And distribution is one of the challenges, actually,

283
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.940
with this approach.

284
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.980
Is it a one and done or do

285
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.040
you have to keep injecting people with this?

286
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.320
They need repeated injections at intervals of weeks.

287
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.180
That's what this trial is set up to

288
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:41.480
do.

289
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.760
This stage, which is a first in human

290
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.740
trial, they're testing for safety and for how

291
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.780
the drug is metabolized in the body to

292
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.460
get to appropriate dosing levels.

293
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.640
Are they also looking at some other endpoints?

294
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.060
Are they looking to see if they can

295
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.760
decrease disease markers or something?

296
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.440
There is a biomarker in the cerebrospinal fluid

297
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.540
that can be followed by collecting it at

298
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.680
regular intervals, which I believe this trial will

299
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.060
do.

300
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.840
And the biomarker is basically the normal human

301
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.220
prion protein, because what this ASO intends to

302
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.980
do is shut down production of normal protein.

303
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.000
Because without normal protein, then the misfolding can't

304
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.340
happen.

305
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.260
Are people OK if they don't have any

306
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.220
of the normal protein?

307
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.280
Several animal species have been engineered to completely

308
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.760
lack prion protein.

309
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.060
And even though it's abundant in the brain

310
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.580
and serves lots of different functions, it's thought

311
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.560
these animals have been fine.

312
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.780
There's one issue in some of the older

313
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.780
mice with a peripheral neuropathy that develops with

314
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.260
time.

315
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.040
But, you know, the risk benefit ratio for

316
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.740
humans is pretty clear.

317
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.780
What about in people?

318
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.460
Are there people who have had like none

319
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:50.840
of this?

320
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.560
No, but there are a few adults who

321
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.140
have been found who had only half the

322
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.160
regular allotment.

323
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.300
In other words, one of their genes wasn't

324
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.540
functional for normal prion protein.

325
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.600
And they were found in late middle age

326
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.940
or as elderly people.

327
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.900
And they had had kids and they didn't

328
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.200
seem to have any problems.

329
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.880
So that's one approach that's being tried and

330
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.400
it's moved into clinical trials.

331
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.480
There's also these other approaches you talk about,

332
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.140
like zinc fingers.

333
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:17.780
Yeah.

334
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.920
That's something I know interlocks with DNA, but

335
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.440
that's all I got.

336
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.340
How does that work?

337
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:21.780
Yeah.

338
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.200
If you picture the sort of progression of

339
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.100
prion disease, starting with the DNA being transcribed

340
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.580
to make messenger RNA.

341
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.580
So the DNA is the first step.

342
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.380
That's where zinc fingers attack.

343
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.540
And they are naturally occurring proteins that a

344
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.740
company, Sangamo, has tailored to attack specifically prion

345
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.220
DNA and prevent it from ever being turned

346
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:44.960
into mRNA.

347
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.000
So that you're way upstream of the protein

348
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.180
actually being produced.

349
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.200
Now, it needs to be said, Sangamo is

350
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.520
in animals still.

351
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.500
They're not in the clinic like Ionis is

352
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.440
with their ASO.

353
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.080
So then if you move to the right

354
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.620
along this timeline of protein production, you get

355
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.240
the mRNA.

356
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.500
And that's where Ionis's antisense oligonucleotide attacks.

357
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.400
And then if you move just a little

358
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.740
further along to where the polypeptide chain of

359
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.560
the protein is being made by a ribosome

360
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.480
that's glued to the endoplasmic reticulum where final

361
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.260
protein assembly steps happen, that's where yet another

362
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.480
approach works being made by GATE Bioscience, which

363
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.680
would be able to take to block those

364
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.200
final steps of production of the prion protein.

365
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.860
Again, all three approaches are trying to just

366
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.700
zero out prion protein because without it, you

367
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.060
cannot have misfolding.

368
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.180
That is a question of like when this

369
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.760
intervention would be ideal.

370
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.020
Any one of these blocking the production of

371
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.460
prion proteins, would you want it if someone

372
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.780
had genetic testing and thought that they had

373
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.460
a prion protein mutation that was going to

374
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.380
lead to misfolding?

375
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.700
Would you want to do it super early?

376
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.640
Oh, yes.

377
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.420
And that's something I meant to circle back

378
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.940
to when you asked about the very different

379
00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.660
approaches to the clinical trials.

380
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.640
This is not a prevention trial that's currently

381
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.360
going on.

382
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.860
But that is the aim of Ionis is

383
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.360
to get to where you can identify people

384
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.780
carrying the genetic mutations who have a certainty

385
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.900
of developing prion disease and treat them years

386
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.740
or decades ahead of the disease developing.

387
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.440
And one of the biggest advocates and real

388
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.920
workers in the trenches to make this kind

389
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.480
of trial happen is Sonia Vallab at the

390
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.060
Broad Institute, whose mother died of a prion

391
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.100
disease at age 52, and who herself has

392
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.260
inherited the mutation that caused that disease.

393
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.280
And she is working feverishly with her husband,

394
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.760
lots of other collaborators to get to a

395
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.980
point where you could have a therapy that

396
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.720
would zero out prion protein production, given preventively

397
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.160
to people who are bound to develop the

398
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.200
disease, but do not yet have symptoms.

399
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.380
And just to reiterate what you said, these

400
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.640
people changed their careers because they realized that

401
00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.660
she had a prion disease.

402
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.320
They went and got PhDs and they became

403
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.400
part of the research community.

404
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.440
And they are a big motivator behind a

405
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.760
lot of the work that's being done.

406
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.500
And driving some of the funding because this

407
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.820
is a super rare disease.

408
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.840
It's a very hard target to hit.

409
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.220
It's fast moving.

410
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.560
And yet here we're seeing, you know, a

411
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.980
real forward momentum in the field that you

412
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.420
kind of would think would be pretty abandoned

413
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.520
or orphaned.

414
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:25.900
Yeah.

415
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.860
And a lot of that is to Sonia

416
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.660
and Eric's credit.

417
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.740
And of course, to the prion research community

418
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.720
more broadly, who have really rallied and worked

419
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.200
with them and been very, I think, moved

420
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.520
by Sonia and Eric's motivation.

421
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.080
And Sonia and Eric are involved not only,

422
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.820
you know, they did pre-clinical work for

423
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.260
Ionis to get the current trial launched, but

424
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.380
they're also working with Sangamo to test the

425
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.140
zinc fingers.

426
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.600
And they're working with this company, Gate Bioscience,

427
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.480
which is developing that pill I alluded to

428
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.860
that would shut down the final stages of

429
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.020
prion protein production.

430
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.640
They got fingers in lots of pies and

431
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.300
they are just wickedly smart and so motivated.

432
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.040
They're really extraordinary people.

433
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.320
We talked about some of the hurdles, getting

434
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.900
patients, getting these materials into the brain is

435
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.760
always a challenge.

436
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.100
And then also zeroing out prion.

437
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.120
There's just a lot to overcome to make

438
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.420
this work.

439
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.800
Have we seen any success in other diseases

440
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.260
with some of the approaches that you're talking

441
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.780
about today that are being tried for prion

442
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.120
diseases?

443
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.820
Yes.

444
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.160
So Ionis, the company that made the ASO

445
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.760
that's now in a clinical trial, has had

446
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.340
mixed success developing ASOs for a number of

447
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.620
neurological diseases.

448
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.300
They had one for Huntington's that was a

449
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.300
big disappointment, but they had one that they

450
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.240
developed for a very small portion of ALS

451
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.860
patients that got approved by FDA last year.

452
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.820
And perhaps most noticeably, they had an ASO

453
00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.140
approved in 2016 for spinal muscular atrophy, this

454
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.339
rare inherited disease that cripples kids from the

455
00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.940
very earliest days of life.

456
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.220
And that is being widely used.

457
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.160
So there have been some successes.

458
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.099
That's great.

459
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.540
They're also a work on one for Alzheimer's.

460
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.839
So stay tuned.

461
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.500
Yeah, I was going to say that's a

462
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.099
really good segue.

463
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.920
This brings up something that I think came

464
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.400
up in your story, the idea that, you

465
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.839
know, this is a rare disease, a very

466
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.560
specific mechanism at the beginning.

467
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.819
But, you know, the formation of aggregates is

468
00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.000
common to other neurodegenerative diseases that we know

469
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.200
about.

470
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.580
Is Alzheimer's a disease that might benefit from

471
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.940
our understanding of prion diseases?

472
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:36.800
Absolutely.

473
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.760
And also Parkinson's.

474
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.320
I mean, there's misfolding of proteins that then

475
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.440
form aggregates that then do brain damage in

476
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.580
both those diseases, which particularly Alzheimer's is clearly

477
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.920
much, much more common.

478
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.960
And Parkinson's is not uncommon either.

479
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.220
The learnings and the applications of what's learned

480
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.540
in this trial and in prion disease approaches,

481
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.160
generally, definitely could have relevance to these commoner

482
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.720
neurodegenerative diseases.

483
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.340
Okay, Meredith, before I let you go, I

484
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.200
just wanted to circle back to kind of

485
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.300
what we started talking about, which is your

486
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.140
friend, Charlie.

487
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.340
He was a journalist.

488
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.020
He was writing a weekly column about the

489
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.600
community that he lives in.

490
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.820
And then he's hit with this like slew

491
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.100
of strange symptoms.

492
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.160
And even to the last, you know, he

493
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.940
didn't, he did not survive very long past

494
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:29.780
when he was diagnosed.

495
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.540
He still continued to show how much he

496
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.300
cares and contributes to the community around him.

497
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.680
And this just really comes across in the

498
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680
way you write about him.

499
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.000
Yes, Charlie, when the doctor diagnosed him, this

500
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.860
was like eight or 12 days before he

501
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.040
died, he reached out and shook his hand

502
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.840
and told the doctor, congratulations for solving the

503
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.200
mystery.

504
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.480
And then within a few days, he made

505
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.300
very clear that he wanted to donate his

506
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.580
brain for research.

507
00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.060
And the one place that collects all the

508
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.440
brains of people who died with suspected prion

509
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.500
disease in the United States is the National

510
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.820
Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western

511
00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.120
Reserve University.

512
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.260
And that's where Charlie's brain is.

513
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.620
And in fact, that is also the first

514
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.540
trial site in the current trial.

515
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.220
So I was able to go out and

516
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.600
meet Brian Appleby, who directs the surveillance center

517
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.800
and also is the main investigator on the

518
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.620
clinical trial.

519
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.680
And it just so happened that the day

520
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.860
I was there, he got the results from

521
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.320
Charlie's brain that showed that Charlie had not

522
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.320
had a mutation that he might've passed to

523
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.120
his daughters, that it was sporadic.

524
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:38.780
Oh, wow.

525
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.540
And that he'd had a certain gene variation

526
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.800
that made it very rapidly progressive.

527
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.580
And it was really moving.

528
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.820
And Brian said to me, after talking to

529
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.420
Charlie's wife, Ellen, that he had learned that

530
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.240
Charlie was a journalist.

531
00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.040
And wow, what a great final contribution this

532
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.620
was to be part of this story.

533
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.040
Meredith Wadman is a staff writer for Science.

534
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.900
You can find a link to the story

535
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.420
we discussed at science.org slash podcast.

536
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.300
Stay tuned for producer Katherine Irving and researcher

537
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.100
Ashley Larson.

538
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.300
They chat about the spillover effects of organic

539
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:12.960
agriculture.

540
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.510
I think most of us have heard of

541
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.890
organic agriculture, but what we probably don't know

542
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.110
is that what happens on an organic farm

543
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.350
doesn't necessarily stay on that organic farm.

544
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.750
What goes on on an organic farm could

545
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.510
actually affect how surrounding farms take care of

546
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.050
their crops.

547
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.850
This week in science, Ashley Larson and her

548
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.790
colleagues report a discovery about the spillover effect

549
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.350
of organic farms onto non-organic farms.

550
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.390
Hi, Ashley, welcome to the podcast.

551
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:47.730
Hi, thank you for having me.

552
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.670
So your paper, as I just mentioned, talks

553
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.410
kind of a lot about organic agriculture.

554
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:53.790
And I think a lot of us have

555
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.490
an idea of what that is, but just

556
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.730
in case, can you give us sort of

557
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.570
a quick explanation about this method and why

558
00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.090
some might consider it better for the planet,

559
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:02.670
quote unquote?

560
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.290
Sure, so organic agriculture is a production system

561
00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.930
that generally relies on more natural production methods.

562
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.610
So in the US, organic agriculture is governed

563
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.710
by the National Organic Program.

564
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.310
And particularly when we think about pesticides, it

565
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.070
often means they're relying on more natural pest

566
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.210
control methods.

567
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.150
So not necessarily no pesticides, but generally no

568
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.330
synthetic pesticides except those that have particular exceptions.

569
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.010
You talk a little bit in the paper

570
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.230
about your environmental footprint.

571
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:32.790
How does it kind of affect that?

572
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.510
A lot of people think that organic agriculture

573
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.990
is basically one potential solution to reduce the

574
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.450
environmental footprint of agriculture because of this reliance

575
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.670
on more natural production methods, particularly, again, related

576
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.970
to pests and pest control.

577
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.730
The big picture, and particularly when we account

578
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.230
for yield differences, the environmental impacts of organics

579
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.430
are not fully understood.

580
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.170
And most of that research has happened at

581
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:54.850
the field scale.

582
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.050
So comparing organic and conventional fields with respect

583
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.630
to biodiversity or soil quality or economic outcomes,

584
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:02.890
social outcomes, et cetera.

585
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.730
But when we think about pests in particular

586
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.310
and their natural enemies or predators, right, these

587
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.270
are mobile organisms.

588
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.050
And so what happens or the decision made

589
00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.230
at the fields might have impacts for their

590
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.610
neighbors.

591
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.690
And that's really what we're trying to get

592
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.630
at here is we're interested in studying whether

593
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.430
organic cropland has these spillover impacts for nearby

594
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.910
growers.

595
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.690
So if this method is considered more environmentally

596
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.550
friendly or more sustainable for the land, is

597
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.090
there a reason why we don't see it

598
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.690
super often?

599
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.250
I think it only makes up about 2

600
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.830
% of global agriculture.

601
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.390
I think it is growing, but of course

602
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.030
there are different challenges.

603
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:39.950
Some of it might be economics.

604
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.150
Some of it might be just farmer behavior

605
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:42.790
and knowledge.

606
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.870
There are different structures that result in sort

607
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.890
of the land use trajectories we see today.

608
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.130
You talk a lot about spillover from these

609
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.290
farms in your paper, but what is it

610
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.150
that's spilling over?

611
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.050
Is it pests, pesticide usage?

612
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.350
So we're thinking in particular about fields.

613
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.630
Farmer can have multiple fields, but we're thinking

614
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.310
about those field interactions in space.

615
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.790
And so, as I mentioned before, pests and

616
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.970
natural enemies of pests, which are a wide

617
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.310
group of different organisms.

618
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.730
We can think of insect natural enemies like

619
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.190
beetles, for example, ladybird beetles.

620
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.210
We can also think of parasitic wasps.

621
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.670
We might also be thinking about spiders.

622
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.930
We might be thinking about birds.

623
00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.870
We might be thinking about bats.

624
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.950
There's a huge variety of different organisms that

625
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.070
consume insect pests.

626
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.290
They're mobile organisms.

627
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.910
And we think that they respond to both

628
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.090
local and landscape characteristics, field size or presence

629
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.410
of hedgerows, or in this case, the question

630
00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.430
was organic agriculture.

631
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.310
So how would you expect this spillover to

632
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.630
influence surrounding growers?

633
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.010
There's both an ecological and an economic aspect

634
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:48.490
to this.

635
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.170
And I'm an ecologist, so I think more

636
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.790
about the ecological aspect, which is exactly the

637
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.110
pests and predators and their movement in space

638
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.350
and how they're impacted by these local and

639
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.310
landscape characteristics.

640
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.150
But on the economic side, and my colleague,

641
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.170
Frederick Nowak, who's co-author on this paper

642
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.950
is an economist, but we think in economics

643
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.530
that farmers might also interact, right?

644
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.830
It could be that this change in pests

645
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.750
that are spilling over onto your field affect

646
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.410
your pesticide use decisions.

647
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.330
It might be that you spray more in

648
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.870
response to pests, but it might be that

649
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.470
there's just such an influx of pests that

650
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.010
your benefits of spraying are actually reduced because

651
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.110
you treat, but pests come back.

652
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.110
And so perhaps you actually spray less if

653
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.030
your neighbor sprays less.

654
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.110
And lastly, it could be that you just

655
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.350
learn.

656
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.730
You look over the fence and you see

657
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.590
that your neighbor is doing something different and

658
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.230
you learn from it.

659
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.110
And so these different fields give us these

660
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.890
different hypotheses about how organic agriculture and the

661
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.370
landscape might affect a nearby growers.

662
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.430
And that's basically what we're trying to get

663
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.750
at with these spillovers, because your decision to

664
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:54.050
produce organic affects something beyond the boundaries of

665
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:54.510
your field.

666
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.130
Mm-hmm.

667
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.990
To do this, you analyzed a lot of

668
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.770
data that was in Kern County, which is

669
00:24:58.770 --> 00:24:59.730
in Southern California.

670
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.110
Was there a particular reason you chose this

671
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.330
area?

672
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.730
Yes, there are a couple reasons, right?

673
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.670
One is that Kern County is a really

674
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.130
interesting agricultural system.

675
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.450
It's often either the top or top couple

676
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.610
agricultural producing counties in terms of value.

677
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.050
It also grows a wide diversity of crops

678
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.210
like almonds, pistachios, these high value, high pesticide

679
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.270
use crops.

680
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.210
And so it's a really interesting, intensive, diverse

681
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.450
agricultural system.

682
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.650
And then on a more practical side, it's

683
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.010
also a very data-rich system.

684
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.670
And so it's a place where we have

685
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.470
field level pesticide use data.

686
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.050
We have field level crop and farmer information,

687
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.550
and we have information on certified organic agriculture.

688
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.210
So it sort of all comes together that

689
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.650
we have good data and we have an

690
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.490
interesting system.

691
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.110
And so it seems the appropriate place to

692
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.510
focus our attention.

693
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.090
You were assessing a couple of questions.

694
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.050
So you were looking at how organic farms

695
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.850
influence other organic farms, how they influence non

696
00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.030
-organic farms, and then also what specific pesticides

697
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.150
or things they were causing to change.

698
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.070
So how did you go about measuring all

699
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.190
of these questions and these impacts?

700
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.730
So the first aspect was really identifying where

701
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.230
organic agriculture was.

702
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.490
And this is actually quite tricky, even with

703
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.850
all the data I mentioned, because we have

704
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.630
information on where certified organic agriculture is, but

705
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.030
often we don't know the exact field.

706
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.930
And so we need to understand, well, which

707
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:24.910
of the potential fields are organic.

708
00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.170
And so we have to bring in some

709
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.170
of that pesticide use data to identify which

710
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.390
potential fields only use approved pesticides or no

711
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.650
pesticides in order to identify which ones are

712
00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.310
actually organic.

713
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.190
And then once we know which fields are

714
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.850
organic, then we can measure how much organic

715
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.730
agriculture is surrounding each of the roughly 14

716
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.550
,000 fields that are permitted in Kern County

717
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.290
each year.

718
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.390
And that's basically how we build our data

719
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.770
set.

720
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:50.990
And then we rely on a series of

721
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.750
mostly panel data models, trying to leverage this

722
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.550
multi-year data set and account for things

723
00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:01.030
like farmer-specific behavior, crop-specific heterogeneity and

724
00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.850
pesticide use, year characteristics that might affect all

725
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.170
fields within the system, and some regional aspects

726
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.790
such as soil quality or something of the

727
00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.050
sort that might also interact with both organics

728
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.030
and pesticide use.

729
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.090
And so our main results rely on these

730
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.250
panel data models, and then we do some

731
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.210
simulations based on those results.

732
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.530
So what, if anything, surprised you the most

733
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.090
about the results that you got?

734
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.030
It's a great question.

735
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.650
Beyond the street is the whole project was

736
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.250
pretty exciting and surprising.

737
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.610
We hadn't looked at the spillover effects for

738
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.230
organics before.

739
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.610
So, you know, the most exciting part was

740
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.450
just getting our initial results and then trying

741
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.730
to turn over as many different rocks, so

742
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.390
to speak, to see whether they were robust

743
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.670
as we could.

744
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.070
And the truth is we were, I think,

745
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.410
riding pretty high the whole time since it

746
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.930
was such a novel project for us.

747
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:50.410
Yeah, and it kind of seemed like you

748
00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.390
got some two sort of related but different

749
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.570
results where organic farms together, there were decreased

750
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.550
insecticides when there were lots of them that

751
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.190
could be together, but it seemed like the

752
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.850
non-organic farms were increasing their pesticide use

753
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.310
when surrounded by organic farms, which is a

754
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.190
fascinating result.

755
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.730
It's really interesting.

756
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.850
As mentioned a little bit earlier, there's some

757
00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.570
different ecological and economic underpinnings to this research.

758
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.170
And in the economics literature, we might actually

759
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.070
have anticipated that sure farmers might increase their

760
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.030
pesticide use in response to increasing pests, but

761
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.050
if there's all this spillover, they might actually

762
00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.690
decrease it and sort of a race to

763
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.170
the bottom.

764
00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.130
Or they might just look over and look

765
00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.970
at their neighbor who's organic, using less pesticides

766
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.230
and try it, right?

767
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.830
Just learn their neighbor.

768
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.930
In both cases, we'd expect a decrease in

769
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.610
pesticide use on conventional fields.

770
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.390
And we actually see an increase.

771
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.730
We basically hypothesized that it's due to different

772
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:53.230
reliance on natural enemies or natural predators of

773
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.050
pests, that on organic fields, there's perhaps a

774
00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.710
larger population of natural enemies that are available

775
00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:02.010
to sort of quickly control these incoming pests,

776
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.590
whereas on conventional fields, that natural enemy community

777
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.510
is lacking.

778
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.370
And so if there's a spillover of both

779
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.930
natural enemies and pests, conventional fields perhaps either

780
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.370
have lower spray thresholds or receive more of

781
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.650
those costs they don't have the natural enemy

782
00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.070
community.

783
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.230
And so how do your results connect to

784
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.670
that distribution of organic and non-organic farms?

785
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.250
Basically, our simulation suggests at low levels of

786
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.930
organic cropland that effect on conventional dominates.

787
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.950
So we actually have an increase in insecticide

788
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.470
use relative to if there was zero organic.

789
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.370
But as organic becomes more prevalent in the

790
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.030
landscape, we see a decrease, as you might

791
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.410
expect, because we start having more of those

792
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.170
organic on organic impacts, as well as the

793
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.790
direct effect organic on insecticides.

794
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.790
And so basically if you cluster, then you

795
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.770
sort of harness all the benefits of organic

796
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.530
on organic, and you minimize those costs of

797
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:54.770
organic on conventional.

798
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.050
So by spatially separating organic and conventional fields,

799
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.970
you basically...
