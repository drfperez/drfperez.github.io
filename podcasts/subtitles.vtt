Sarah Crespi: This is the Science podcast for May 22nd, 2024. I'm Sarah Crespi. First
up, hope in the field of deadly prion diseases. Prions are these misfolded proteins that clump
together and chew holes in the brain. The misfolding of these normal proteins can be switched on in
a number of ways, genetics, spontaneous folding and infection with a misfolded prion from another
animal or person. Staff writer Meredith Wadman walks me through new potential treatments for
these always fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Next up on the show producer, Katherine Irving talks
with researcher Ashley Larsen about the effects of organic farms on their neighbors. If there are
very few organic farms, conventional farms actually tend to increase their pesticide use. But if
organic farms are a cluster together, the pesticide use goes down for everyone.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:02:05.400
SC: Prion diseases have a very strange mechanism. Prion start as a normal protein with a
normal function in the brain. These prions can mis-fold or adopt another shape and then cause other
prion proteins to also mis-fold. These misfolded proteins accumulate and slowly, surely destroy the
brain. Neurodegenerative prion Diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob in humans and Bovine Spongiform
encephalitis in cows can actually infect others in certain circumstances. Like you might have to eat
part of the cow. And there are also certain ways for humans to pass this to another, no matter which
way you get it, it's also genetic versions. It's a hundred percent fatal. Attempts to find treatments for
prion diseases have really been stymied since the discovery of these mechanisms in the 1980s. But
this week in science staff writer Meredith Wadman, wrote about new tactics to take on prion
diseases that are giving hope to researchers and patients. Hi Meredith. Welcome back to the
podcast.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.500
Meredith Wadman: Hi Sarah. I'm glad to be here.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:25.000
SC: Yeah, I'm happy to have you. Although this is a pretty intense story. You have a lot of
people that you talk to that are either had this disease, are studying this disease because they have
family or enrolled in the trials. It's an impactful piece for sure.
